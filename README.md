### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Myself is Under Construction. 

:eyes: To view my most recent projects, please, visit: <a href="https://github.com/Accessibility-Security-Development">Accessibility and security are cool!</a>
<br/>
<br/>
:hammer: The projects listed here, were created to practice aspects of development and may not be complete (yet).
<br/>
Actually, some of them were never meant to be completed and will remain longing their completion in eternity. :cry::cry::cry:

ðŸ“« How to reach me: This is a good question... without an easy answer. 
<br/>
You could try: jobs@infosec.mailer.me.
<br/>
It may work!
